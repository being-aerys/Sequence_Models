# Sequence_Models
I created this repo during my initial encounter with RNNs to learn training LSTM.<br>
Currently intended to contain
1. Character-Level Text Generation
2. Bitcoin Price Prediction.
3. Image Captioning in Nepali (hidden at the moment as that code needs some cleaning and refactoring).
